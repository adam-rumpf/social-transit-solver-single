	To explain a few technical details, the label setting algorithm involves updating a distance label for each node. In each iteration, we choose the unprocessed arc with the minimum value of its own cost plus its head's label. In order to speed up that search, we store all of those values in a min-priority queue. As with Dijkstra's algorithm, to get around the inability to update priorities, we just add extra copies to the queue whenever they are updated. We also store a master list of those values, which should always decrease as the algorithm moves forward, as a comparison every time we pop something out of the queue to ensure that we have the latest version.

	The arc loading algorithm involves processing all of the selected attractive arcs in descending order of their cost-plus-head-label from the label setting algorithm. This is accomplished in a similar way, with a copy of the cost-plus-head-label being added to a max-priority queue each time the tail label is updated.
