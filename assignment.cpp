This model comes from the linear program formulation of the common line problem, which can be solved using a Dijkstra-like label setting algorithm.

Calculates the flow vector to a given sink.

Requires the sink index (as a position in the stop node list), flow vector, waiting time scalar, and line frequency vector.

The flow vector and waiting time are passed by reference and automatically incremented according to the results of this function.

The algorithm here solves the constant-cost, single-destination version of the common lines problem, which is a LP similar to min-cost flow and is solvable with a Dijkstra-like label setting algorithm. This process can be parallelized over all destinations, and so should rely only on local variables.

	To explain a few technical details, the label setting algorithm involves updating a distance label for each node. In each iteration, we choose the unprocessed arc with the minimum value of its own cost plus its head's label. In order to speed up that search, we store all of those values in a min-priority queue. As with Dijkstra's algorithm, to get around the inability to update priorities, we just add extra copies to the queue whenever they are updated. We also store a master list of those values, which should always decrease as the algorithm moves forward, as a comparison every time we pop something out of the queue to ensure that we have the latest version.

Returns a pair containing a vector of flow values and a waiting time scalar.

The solution vector is used to determine the frequency and capacity of each line. Frequencies contribute to boarding arc costs for the common lines problem, while capacities contribute to an overcrowding penalty to model congestion.

The overall process being used here is the Frank-Wolfe algorithm, which iteratively solves the linear approximation of the nonlinear cost quadratic program. That linear approximation happens to be an instance of the constant-cost LP whose costs are based on the current solution.
